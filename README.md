Hi all, Im Jesica, Before start i want to say:

I finished my fulltime bootcamp in web development a little less than a month ago and today I'm reinforcing my new skills in MERN tech stack, one small project at a time...

I know that the only way to learn to code is to code. This way, I know that I will be able to deepen my resources and create more and more challenging digital products.

##Task App

This application is a tool that helps to prioritize instructions to perform technical tests, such as the one I had to perform to develop it.
It is a task manager that allows you to create, prioritize, edit and delete tasks.

## What do you can make in app

- Read your list of tasks 
- Create a task
- Asigne priority level at a task 
- Edit a task 
- Delete a task

## You need to know...
Priority chart: 
1) HIGH PRIO
2) MIDDLE PRIO
3) LOW PRIO

# Lets goo to our app...

## Before to start

Install yarn in your local machine [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## 1. You need install app dependencies

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

## 2. And Run the app (In mac or Linux)

### `yarn start`

Runs the app with JSON-SERVER to mock API\
Api ->  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\
app ->  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

The page will reload if you create, delete or modify any task.

## TEST APP
During the bootcamp we became familiar with Jasmine as a testing tool. Although we did not write tests with Jasmine, we were able to appreciate its code.
From this moment I was able to apply basic tests with Jest. These are unit tests, located in each component folder. I understand that Testing is a key concept to develop better and better. That is why I wanted to sketch a line in this regard, which, without being a testing strategy or much less, if it enables refactoring possibilities.
