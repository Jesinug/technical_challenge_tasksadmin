# A task organizer por code newbies

## Before starting, just a bit of context
Hi all, Im Jesica.

I finished my fulltime bootcamp in web development a little less than a month ago and today I'm reinforcing my new skills in MERN tech stack, one small project at a time (following some advice).

I know that the only way to learn to code is to code. This way, I know that I will be able to deepen my resources and create more and more challenging digital products.

## The app
I thought of this application to help those who, like me, are facing the first technical tests in selection processes.
Its function is to help code newbies to deconstruct big problems to put together small ones.

## MVP and app main feature
As MVP I focused on a basic functionality of creating/saving/editing/deleting tasks and assigning priority level.
- Read your list of tasks 
- Create a task
- Asigne priority level at a task 
- Edit a task and it's priority
- Delete a task

## Priority chart
- (1) --> High prio
- (3) --> Middle prio
- (4) --> Low prio

## Tech stack used
React and Typescript.
Material UI library

## Before to start
Install Yarn in your local machine [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## 1. You need install app dependencies
In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn install`

## 2. And Run the app (In mac or Linux)
### `yarn start`

Runs the app with JSON-SERVER to mock API\
Api ->  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\
app ->  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

The page should **automatically reload** if you create, delete or modify any task.

## Testing
During the bootcamp we became familiar with Jasmine as a testing tool. Although we did not write tests with Jasmine, I were able to sneak on its code.
I know that Testing is more than a good practice. I understand that it is rather a concept, a mindset, an idea that is more and more important to be a better programmer.
That's why I wanted to make some attempt in this line within this project. In this case I included some very basic unit tests in each component.
TDD coding is the mindset I feel more comfortable with.

### `yarn start`
